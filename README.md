# PaymentTracker

Money comes and it goes. It builds up our life as we pay for the things we want and need.
Here, with the payment tracker app, you can see your progress towards these things, these goals.

For example, you could build a goal to save 1200 dollars for a trip to Montana.
Or maybe add your car payment or mortgage. 

The idea here is that you can see all of these 'goals' and track them in one place.'

Maybe you are already 60% done paying off your car. Great! Take a look at it through this app for a more visual approach.
With a colorful progress circle, as well as graphs for future outlook, this app is designed to be simple and visually pleasing.
